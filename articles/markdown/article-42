# Corruption Comes to Castro Valley

While investigating a series of animal mutilations in the real world, the players find themselves drawn into an increasingly unfamiliar world of monsters, malicious actors, and magic.

As they are drawn into this previously unrecognized world they start to experience a doubling on memories and eventually of consciousness; first in the form of dejavu moments, then in strangely realistic and detailed dreams, and finally in the actual awareness of another person within their mind and body.

## Paradoxical play

There are a few parts of the action that follows a pattern other than fight-and-win.

First, the visitors must succeed in their project or they will never leave earth. So, while the players try and prevent their destructive schemes, they are actually slowing down the ending of the scourge by doing so. 

For this reason, there needs to be some ethical dimension to drive player intervention in case they start to understand this dynamic. They will have opportunities to guide 'bad' humans into destruction in order to save 'good' humans.

Another trade-off situation is in the above-ground fighting. The more successful the players are in preventing traveler forces from accomplishing their tasks, the larger the scale of defender forces they must face.

These above ground fights are also not simple fight-to-win slugfests. The primary goal is to prevent the small enemies from doing their job, not to defeat the defenders. This creates a two layer battlefield and a range of strategies that can be employed.

Underground fights also allow for strategic nuance. Defeating the sentries and preventing their reporting to and recruiting defenders means the invaders will risk coming on the defenders in large numbers later. Letting some sentries escape to report can allow the invaders to choose their battleground and to some degree control the pace of fights.

Dealing with human minions is not straight forward either. Killing a human minion resets all their plans to zero, but it also means a new, unknown human will be taken over and the plans will start again. The players will need to find the new minion if they want to stop the plans again.

Because of these paradoxical drivers, play will focus on ethical choices and strategic decisions.

In conflicts where the goal is to prevent crimes against citizens or animals, multiple victims must be made available and player choices can either prevent victimization or influence the choice of victim. In some cases the choice may be between two locations and the selection of location is in effect the selection of victim.

In fights that involve strategy and wrong choices might result in character death, the fighters will need to have escape routes available in case things go terribly wrong. Other failures might result in nightmares, bouts of panic or other temporary debilitating conditions.

## Clues

- Creature encounters are used to draw the players to key location
  - For discovery of clues
  - To lead players to 'gateway' locations; places where they can transition into the alternate world
  - To lead players into boon items left by allies
  - To lead players to trap items that are left by agents of enemies to lead them astray or to fail them in critical situations

## Locations

## Characters

### Enemies

#### Travelers

The travelers are actually quite small and not at all strong. They do have the power to control the endocrine system of other beings to such a degree it seems like mind control. But a hit or two will take them out... if you can master yourself.

They lay down mats of underground fibers—like fungus threads—and by touching the end node on a network, they can cause chemicals to emit at various places. These chemicals have a powerful effect on the recipient.

This is their form of communication.

#### Enemy motivation

The enemies have no actual interest in earth, its residents, or anything else. They have just were just traveling from point A to point B with a planned stop-off at a staging area to carry out refueling and arcane rights because the A-to-B distance/dimensional shift was too great for a single step.

These beings had no idea there would be a civilization at this location and barely understand the nature of the place they've come to. So, while they do figure out that they must stay hidden, and even figure out ways to take advantage of human weakness to further their own plans, these interactions are not their goal. They just need to rebuild their resources and accomplish their magical tasks in order to move on to their final destination.

#### Human minions

The travelers operate above ground by using human who's consciousness they've co-opted. Some have been invaded by neural parasites and some through a process of cognitive co-opting. 

The victims of the parasites act distracted in normal interactions and are strangely obsessive in certain areas of interest to them. They engage in elliptical conversations full of non-sequiturs.

The victims of psychic magic are baited with certain ideas in a form that appeals to them. This creates a kind of mental openness that the travelers psychic mages can leverage. Eventually the mages can run the humans like remote systems. They seem unctuous and fawning in conversation and they exhibit strange physical habits like hand wringing or repetitive bowing.

Each human minion is focused on some mysterious task; insuring the presence of some resource at some location at a certain time, acquisition of some materials, causing some individual to make some choice or take some action.

Some quests can center on detecting and thwarting this tasks.

#### Principles of fight evolution

Initial above ground fights center on minion beasts that are doing reconnaissance and who are engaged in ratcheting up control to larger, smarter organisms. 

Later above ground fights are with more destructive creatures that are engaged in resource collection. Some of the resource are psychic/life-force/neural-emotional, some are physical (but bizarre).

The largest above ground fights are against defensive forces that are deployed to prevent character interference with the forces engaged in the first two types of activities.

Initial underground fights are with sentry creatures that are patrolling access points and with messenger creatures that are carrying instructions or materials to and from above ground forces.

The largest underground opponents are various defenders that are called by sentries when intrusion is detected. The largest battles occur when the sentries are defeated and prevented from carrying messages to the defenders and, as a result, the intruders arrive at a fully staffed defender barracks. 

Medium strength underground fights occur when sentries and defenders have been defeated or evaded and the resident creatures are encountered. These are workers and administrators of various types.
#### Urban
