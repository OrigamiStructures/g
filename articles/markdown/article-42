# Corruption Comes to Castro Valley

While investigating a series of animal mutilations, the players find themselves drawn into an increasingly unfamiliar world of monsters, malicious actors, and magic.

As they are drawn into this previously unrecognized world they start to experience a doubling on memories and eventually of consciousness; first in the form of dejavu moments, then in strangely realistic and detailed dreams, and finally in the actual awareness of another person within their mind and body.

## Clues

- Creature encounters are used to draw the players to key location
  - For discovery of clues
  - To lead players to 'gateway' locations; places where they can transition into the alternate world
  - To lead players into boon items left by allies
  - To lead players to trap items that are left by agents of enemies to lead them astray or to fail them in critical situations

- Popcorn
  - From the theater which is next door to the comic store
