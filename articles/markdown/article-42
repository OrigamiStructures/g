While investigating a series of animal mutilations in the real world, the players find themselves drawn into an increasingly unfamiliar world of monsters, malicious actors, and magic.

As they are drawn into this previously unrecognized world they start to experience a doubling on memories and eventually of consciousness; first in the form of dejavu moments, then in strangely realistic and detailed dreams, and finally in the actual awareness of another person within their mind and body.


## Paradoxical play

There are a few parts of the action that follows a pattern other than fight-and-win.

First, the visitors must succeed in their project or they will never leave earth. So, while the players try and prevent their destructive schemes, they are actually slowing down the ending of the scourge by doing so. 

For this reason, there needs to be some ethical dimension to drive player intervention in case they start to understand this dynamic. They will have opportunities to guide 'bad' humans into destruction in order to save 'good' humans.

Another trade-off situation is in the above-ground fighting. The more successful the players are in preventing traveler forces from accomplishing their tasks, the larger the scale of defender forces they must face.

These above ground fights are also not simple fight-to-win slugfests. The primary goal is to prevent the small enemies from doing their job, not to defeat the defenders. This creates a two layer battlefield and a range of strategies that can be employed.

Underground fights also allow for strategic nuance. Defeating the sentries and preventing their reporting to and recruiting defenders means the invaders will risk coming on the defenders in large numbers later. Letting some sentries escape to report can allow the invaders to choose their battleground and to some degree control the pace of fights.

Dealing with human minions is not straight forward either. Killing a human minion resets all their plans to zero, but it also means a new, unknown human will be taken over and the plans will start again. The players will need to find the new minion if they want to stop the plans again.

Because of these paradoxical drivers, play will focus on ethical choices and strategic decisions.

In conflicts where the goal is to prevent crimes against citizens or animals, multiple victims must be made available and player choices can either prevent victimization or influence the choice of victim. In some cases the choice may be between two locations and the selection of location is in effect the selection of victim.

In fights that involve strategy and wrong choices might result in character death, the fighters will need to have escape routes available in case things go terribly wrong. Other failures might result in nightmares, bouts of panic or other temporary debilitating conditions.

## Characters

[Officer Friendly](/article/officer-friendly)

### Enemies

#### Travelers

The travelers are actually quite small and not at all strong. They do have the power to control the endocrine system of other beings to such a degree it seems like mind control. But a hit or two will take them out... if you can master yourself.

They lay down mats of underground fibers—like fungus threads—and by touching the end node on a network, they can cause chemicals to emit at various places. These chemicals have a powerful effect on the recipient.

This is their form of communication.

#### Enemy motivation

The enemies have no actual interest in earth, its residents, or anything else. They have just were just traveling from point A to point B with a planned stop-off at a staging area to carry out refueling and arcane rights because the A-to-B distance/dimensional shift was too great for a single step.

These beings had no idea there would be a civilization at this location and barely understand the nature of the place they've come to. So, while they do figure out that they must stay hidden, and even figure out ways to take advantage of human weakness to further their own plans, these interactions are not their goal. They just need to rebuild their resources and accomplish their magical tasks in order to move on to their final destination.

#### Human minions

The travelers operate above ground by using human who's consciousness they've co-opted. Some have been invaded by neural parasites and some through a process of cognitive co-opting. 

The victims of the parasites act distracted in normal interactions and are strangely obsessive in certain areas of interest to them. They engage in elliptical conversations full of non-sequiturs.

The victims of psychic magic are baited with certain ideas in a form that appeals to them. This creates a kind of mental openness that the travelers psychic mages can leverage. Eventually the mages can run the humans like remote systems. They seem unctuous and fawning in conversation and they exhibit strange physical habits like hand wringing or repetitive bowing.

Each human minion is focused on some mysterious task; insuring the presence of some resource at some location at a certain time, acquisition of some materials, causing some individual to make some choice or take some action.

Some quests can center on detecting and thwarting this tasks.

#### Principles of fight evolution

Initial above ground fights center on minion beasts that are doing reconnaissance and who are engaged in ratcheting up control to larger, smarter organisms. 

Later above ground fights are with more destructive creatures that are engaged in resource collection. Some of the resource are psychic/life-force/neural-emotional, some are physical (but bizarre).

The largest above ground fights are against defensive forces that are deployed to prevent character interference with the forces engaged in the first two types of activities.

Initial underground fights are with sentry creatures that are patrolling access points and with messenger creatures that are carrying instructions or materials to and from above ground forces.

The largest underground opponents are various defenders that are called by sentries when intrusion is detected. The largest battles occur when the sentries are defeated and prevented from carrying messages to the defenders and, as a result, the intruders arrive at a fully staffed defender barracks. 

Medium strength underground fights occur when sentries and defenders have been defeated or evaded and the resident creatures are encountered. These are workers and administrators of various types.
#### Urban

##### Rats
- Normal rats
- Early fights for humans
- Used to draw players to important gateway locations

#### Subterranean

##### The Burrowers Beneath   
   These are the tunnel making worms described [later](#underground-facilities). They come in [three sizes](#worm-dimensions) but they share features and abilities. These are scaled to their size.

- Face covered with tiny, short tentacles that inject acid into the rock. This weakens the rocks and soil so the other features of the worm can extend the tunnel. But when interfered with, this is part of their defense system.  
- These tentacles are so small and numerous they make the face appear furry
- In a ring around the face, and retracted into the body are a set of strong curved spines. Once the rock has been weakened, the spines extend enclosing a hemispherical chunk from the rock.   
   These spines are a secondary part of the worm attack.
- In normal rock-removal behavior, once the acid injection process is complete, the tentacle covering over the face rolls back from its center revealing the iridescent surface of the worms transport membrane. This organ interacts with the injected acid and transports the effected material 
within the grasp of the spikes, to its destination.

##### Tunnel Sentries

Sentries will make an attempt to persuade intruders to retreat. Their designed to repel simple animals motivated by curiosity or the search for food and shelter. The aliens didn't understand determined and motivated humans when they designed the sentries.

They have the head of some captured animal grafted onto a common sentry body. The bodies are scaled to the tunnel being guarded and some attempt is made to place properly scaled heads on the bodies, but in the absence of appropriate material, multiple heads might be used.

They have two deterrent methods, neural dissuasion and bites.

- Body   
  - Sentry bodies are 6 legged mechanical devices. Some are upright similar to a tripod, others are low to the ground, like insects.
  - The attached head sets atop a flexible metal column that encloses the spinal cord
  - There is a long, jointed 'arm' attached at the back, base of the 'neck' that is tipped with a chemical delivery system. This is the sentries deterrent attack tool. The arm, which is normally folded up along the sentries back, extends in an arc over the sentries head—looking like a scorpion stinger—and strikes the intruder to inject a chemical meant to create an aversion response.

- Possible heads
  - Cats
  - Raccoons
  - Rats
  - Rarely, humans
  - Deer (only with antlers)

#### Riparian

##### Creek leaches
- 5' long, fast and agile, constricting with grasping tentacles ringing a lamprey mouth
- the source of initial animal deaths and some early human deaths

##### Water rats
- Early fights for the humans
-  


## Underground facilities

To avoid detection, the aliens excavate underground tunnels and rooms. These spaces are created by teams of worms that use acid, levering/grinding appendages,  and teleportation to break apart the soil and rock, then remove it.

There are three tunnels sizes they construct

- 10"   
   Large enough for the aliens to move around comfortably
- 50"  
   Large enough for animals to move through
- 78"  
   Large enough for humans to move through
- Rooms can be created in all tunnel sizes. The tunneling worms create these spaces also

Each tunnel size has a worm specific to it. There are always 9 worms that work in parallel, exactly filling the tunnel bore. So, each worm in cross-section is 1/9th of the tunnel cross-section. And worms are always 4x longer than their diameter.

### Worm dimensions

- Small
  - Diameter  1-5/8"
  - Length     6-5/8"
- Medium
  - Diameter  8-3/8"
  - Length     33-3/8"
- Large
  - Diameter  13"
  - Length      52"

All worms can bore an average of 6" per hour, 12' per day. The soil they remove is teleported to some random location above ground, determined by mysterious quantum factors at the time the tunnel is created.

A dice role will set the location.

Once a group of worms begins work and the location of the debris is established, the pile of soil will be continuous, forming a linear mound that matches the tunnel and any rooms created.

If the worms stop processing dirt and move to a new location to resume, a new destination role is required.

### Creating worms

Devices must be created that can make the worms. Each device is square, face on, and 3" thick. Its face is large enough to comfortably contain the cross section the worm it creates.  There is one size of device for each size of worm. One device per day can be made by a laborer and once created, the device can make 1" of worm per hour.

Using the size of the worms and the rate of worm creation, we can calculate how many worms are generated each day:

- Small
   - 3.6 worms per day
   - 0.72 worms per day
   - 0.461538462 worms per day

Since the worms work in teams of 9, there is a ramp-up period before the tunnel excavation rate of 12' per day can be reached. For purposes of calculation, even a partial worm is assumed to do some work.

### The initial build

- The first full cohort of small worms are ready on day 4 and the first 12' of tunnel on is produced on day 5. 
- The first medium cohort on day 7 and medium tunnel on day 8. 
- The first large cohort on day 5 and tunnel on day 6.

All initial units are on line and have produced one day's tunnels on day 15. 

In all, 8 cohorts of small (72 worms), 6 cohorts of medium (54 worms), and 6 cohorts of large worms (54 worms) are produced. 

For each size of worm, once the first cohort comes on line, one additional cohort per day will be produced and can be put to work immediately. So, each new cohort produces 12' less tunnel than its predecessor by the end of the initial 15 days. After this, tunnel production is the same for all cohorts.

Totals at the end of day 15 are as follows

- Small
  - 1 : 132'
  - 2 : 120'
  - 3 : 108'
  - 4 : 96'
  - 5 : 84' 
  - 6 : 72'
  - 7 : 60'
  - 8 : 48'
- Medium
  - 1 : 96'
  - 2 : 84'
  - 3 : 72'
  - 4 : 60'
  - 5 : 48' 
  - 6 : 36'
- Large
  - 1 : 72'
  - 2 : 60'
  - 3 : 48'
  - 4 : 36'
  - 5 : 24' 
  - 6 : 12'

To accomplish these rates of production one of each size of worm constructor must be made each day with the first completed on the 3rd day and beginning worm production immediately at that time.

One additional constructor must be made each day thereafter until a required number is reached:

- 9 small
- 9 medium
- 15 large

These devices must then be stored, transported or dismantled. And 3 workers will be occupied with creating them for 9 days, and 1 for an additional 6 days.
