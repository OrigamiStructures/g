# Manager Permission

Management and general sharing of Address Book data is not allowed. Import/export features will be provided for Artists and Managers so they can share this data if they wish, but the system views this as private data belonging to the registered user that created it.

The address data that is stored in Dispositions is also controlled even in cases where a Manager or Artist has access to a disposition created by the other.

- If the Artist creates a disposition for a piece that the Manager has access to, the manager can see the Disposition, its type, date, and other status indicators but cannot see any details of who the work was disposed to.
   - Will this cause difficulty for a manager's awareness of 'prestige' placements for the artist? 
   - This might be solved if the artist can publish CV or other summaries that the manager can receive
- If the Manager creates a disposition for an Artist that is a registered user, that Artist can see the name, state, country of the disposition member (and city?).
   - Would this be enough for the Artist to maintain a complete CV or collector history?

It's not yet defined what *Management* means. 

- The right to dispose pieces?
- The right to create Artworks or layers of them depending on permissions?
- The right to edit Artworks or layers of them depending on permissions?

Clearly, some distinction needs to be made to distinguish Artworks belonging to registered User/Artists that the Manager is permitted to manage and works belonging to Artists that the Manager has created and maintains as a personal record.

In the first case, some kind limits are likely to exist, in the later case, no limits can exist.

A `managerOwned( )` method on the Artist entity might work. I wonder if Artwork/Edition/Format/Piece entities could also deliver this boolean. 

In the current configuration, each method has a creator's user_id, so if that can be maintained, it would support this strategy.

Will there be a situation where a Manager creates an Artist and their works and extends permission to a User that is that Artist? An in this unusual situation, what should the Artist's creation/editing rights be?

It would be convenient to say only the owner of the Artist record can create and edit artworks; permission is only to dispose. But this could leave a situation where a gallery owner can't get an artist to update the data to support a sale.

It is easy to say that this is the artist's and manager's problem. Trash your data and or career if you want. But we want people to use the system, and accounting for human failures can increase use.

So, perhaps the managers have a way to request time-limited create/edit permission from the Artist. And Artists have a way to issue this permission proactively. 

Then the permission system is always for disposition only, unless there is a special flag, then new rules apply for a limited time.

Should this special permission apply to all Manager accessible records or force a newly defined scope?

We could possibly make this a 'one editor at a time'. Assigning temporary create/edit permission would then be a transfer process rather than an 'addition' process. This will relieve us of having to watch for editor collisions and might make edit-history tracking easier.

### 2 strategies for edit permission

The artist record owned by a user could get a timestamp set indicating the end of their editing rights. Then they could be allowed to create/edit for that Artist on all new and permitted works.

But if we want to enable focused edit permission, independent of the normal manager permissions, we'd have to have a whole new permission system or special field indicators in the existing permission records.

## Editing

Proposed rules for a Manager's editing of an Artist's work.

- If the permission links to an Artist, the manager can
   - Edit all levels of all artwork

## problems?

How will limited permissions effect the management of portfolios and 'assembled works' like that? We don't want to extend management to the individual works... But there does need to be some degree of carry-over record access.
