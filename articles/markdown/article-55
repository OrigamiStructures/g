# Manager Permission

Management and general sharing of Address Book data is not allowed. Import/export features will be provided for Artists and Managers so they can share this data if they wish, but the system views this as private data belonging to the registered user that created it.

The address data that is stored in Dispositions is also controlled even in cases where a Manager or Artist has access to a disposition created by the other.

- If the Artist creates a disposition for a piece that the Manager has access to, the manager can see the Disposition, its type, date, and other status indicators but cannot see any details of who the work was disposed to.
   - Will this cause difficulty for a manager's awareness of 'prestige' placements for the artist? 
   - This might be solved if the artist can publish CV or other summaries that the manager can receive
- If the Manager creates a disposition for an Artist that is a registered user, that Artist can see the name, state, country of the disposition member (and city?).
   - Would this be enough for the Artist to maintain a complete CV or collector history?

It's not yet defined what *Management* means. 

- The right to dispose pieces?
- The right to create Artworks or layers of them depending on permissions?
- The right to edit Artworks or layers of them depending on permissions?

Clearly, some distinction needs to be made to distinguish Artworks belonging to registered User/Artists that the Manager is permitted to manage and works belonging to Artists that the Manager has created and maintains as a personal record.

In the first case, some kind limits are likely to exist, in the later case, no limits can exist.

An `usersProperty( )` method on the Artist entity might work. I wonder if Artwork/Edition/Format/Piece entities could also deliver this boolean. 

In the current configuration, each method has a creator's user_id, so if that can be maintained, it would support this strategy.

Will there be a situation where a Manager creates an Artist and their works and extends permission to a User that is that Artist? An in this unusual situation, what should the Artist's creation/editing rights be?

## Editing

Proposed rules for a Manager's editing of an Artist's work.

- If the permission links to an Artist, the manager can
   - Edit all levels of all artwork
