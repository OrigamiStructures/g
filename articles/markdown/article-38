# RenumberRequest Flags and Messages

## Role of the class

RenumberRequest (RR) objects are primarily record-and-report objects. They contain almost no logic to determine the validity of a request. Only the containing class RenumberRequests (RRs) has the context required for this task.

As RRs receives and stores RR objects, it sets flags using the provided methods in each RR to indicate its state according to the rule set in RRs.

RR has a the `message( )` method which outputs an array of messages that describe the internal state of the request; the nature of any error, ambiguities, and/or the expected action that will result on execution of the request.
