# Manifest Terminology

This is a different way of exploring the ideas Jason was going to look at. His approach is to define specific example relationships that could be described by Manifests.

## Roles and possible names

- A Manifest record identifying Supervisor/Manager/Artist
   - ArtistManifest
- A Manifest record identifying only Supervisor/Manager
   - ManagerManifest
- A Manifest which names the user as Supervisor but not as Manager
   - AssignedManagers
   - ManagementStaff (preferred?)
- A Manifest which names the user as Manager, but not as Supervisor
   - ManagementResponsibilities (preferred?)
   - AssignedResponsibilities
- Manifests that identify self-owned Artists
   - OwnedArtists (preferred?)
   - Artists
- Manifests that identify self-owned-artists that have assigned ManagementStaff
   - ManagedArtists
- The stack or page that explains the permissions and details of one Manager regarding one Artist
   - ManagementAgreement

I don't think there would need to be a manifest to define self-as-manager because the record would not define anything that couldn't be assumed about the user. Manifests to define self-owned-artists on the other hand are required to define the artist (?)

This may not actually be true. I think the self-owned-artists need manifests so handling of artists becomes normalized no matter which variety arrives in code. I wonder if manager manifests need to be generated for the same reason.

## Organizing the pages

Using these terms, here are possible pages, the kind of manifests they focus on, and what tasks they facilitate.

## Supervisor Page

- ManagementStaff
   - Choosing one of the listed managers take this supervisor [to a page](#supervise-manager) where they can view and adjust the details of the assignments made to that manager
   - A tool to recruit/acknowledge an new manager
      - From existing person
      - From person defined on the fly
      - Respond to pending requests-to-manage that have been received (or are these emailed links that never appear in the system?)
      - A list of pending recruitment offeres for reminder/deletion?
- ManagedArtists
   - Choosing one of the listed artists takes this supervisor  [to a page](#supervise-artist)  where they can view and adjust details of their managers
   - A tool to identify a new artist
      - From existing person
      - From person defined on the fly

### Supervise/Manager/:id

- ManagedArtists for the single ManagementStaff
    - Each artist can be revoked from this page and is linked to the details of this management agreement

#### Supervise/Manager/Artist/:id/:id

- Details of a single ManagementAgreement

### Supervise/Artist/:id

- ManagementStaff for the single ManagedArtist

#### Supervise/Artist/Manager/:id/:id

- Details of a single ManagementAgreement
