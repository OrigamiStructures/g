# Manifest Terminology

This is a different way of exploring the ideas Jason was going to look at. His approach is to define specific example relationships that could be described by Manifests.

## Roles and possible names

- A Manifest record identifying Supervisor/Manager/Artist
   - ArtistManifest
- A Manifest record identifying only Supervisor/Manager
   - ManagerManifest
- A Manifest which names the user as Supervisor but not as Manager
   - AssignedManagers
   - ManagementStaff
- A Manifest which names the user as Manager, but not as Supervisor
   - ManagementResponsibilities
   - AssignedResponsibilities
- Manifests that identify self-owned Artists
   - OwnedArtists
   - Artists

I don't think there would need to be a manifest to define self-as-manager because the record would not define anything that couldn't be assumed about the user. Manifests to define self-owned-artists on the other hand are required to define the artist (?)

This may not actually be true. I think the self-owned-artists need manifests so handling of artists becomes normalized no matter which variety arrives in code. I wonder if manager manifests need to be generated for the same reason.
