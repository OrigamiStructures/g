# AddressBook Object: A Proposal

The RolodexCard hierarchy is build and feels like it will be generally useful. But there is no organized way to work with the many cards. Perhaps an AddressBook object could step in here.

```php

 /**
  * AddressBook Object
  *
  * There may be two versions of this, a Summary and a Detail version. 
  * They could be the same class with a contructor option or two classes.
  * The User object would contain the Summary version so that we would 
  * have brief but useful access to the address book at need. 
  * The actual AddressBook page (or related pages?) would get the Detail version.
  */
 class AddressBook {

    /**
     * A StackSet
     */
    protected $PersonCards;

    /**
     * A StackSet
    */
    protected $OrganizationCards;

    /**
     * A StackSet
     */
    protected $GroupCards;

    /**
     * Other properties if needed
     */

    /**
     * What interface calls would make this useful?
     *
     * One reasonable approach is to make this class in the controller, then 
     * send it to the view and write methods on it as a need is found. 
     * Because I can't think of anything right off the top of my head.
     */
