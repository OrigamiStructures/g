# AddressBook Object: A Proposal

```php

 /**
  * AddressBook Object
  *
  * There may be two versions of this, a Summary and a Detail version. 
  * They could be the same class with a contructor option or two classes.
  * The User object would contain the Summary version so that we would 
  * have brief but useful access to the address book at need. 
  * The actual AddressBook page (or related pages?) would get the Detail version.
  /*
 class AddressBook {

    /**
     * A StackSet
     */
    protected $PersonCards;

    /**
     * A StackSet
    */
    protected $OrganizationCards;

    /**
     * A StackSet
     */
    protected $GroupCards;

    /**
     * Other properties if needed
     */

    /**
     * What interface calls would make this useful?
     *
     * One reasonable approach is to make this class in the controller, then 
     * send it to the view and write methods on it as a need is found. 
     * Because I can't think of anything right off the top of my head.
     */
