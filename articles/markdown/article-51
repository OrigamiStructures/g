# CCtoCV: The Fighter's Quest for Level 2

A fighter's abilities come from an alien device that works in the way a robotic exoskeleton does. However, since the aliens have technology that allow them to control the natural world in much more sophisticated ways than human technology, there is no need for armatures, braces, straps, motors, and hinges. Instead the fighter wears a series of metal bands that enhance their strength, agility, and prowess with weaponry.

This set of bands must be stolen from a facility where they are manufactured (the Quonset hut at the west end of town). Once the bands are on on a person, they cannot be transferred to another. So the only time to acquire the device is after manufacture and before an ownership claim.

Two acquire them, a person must enter a space bounded by devices. After the equipment is prepared, a person just has to enter this space and the devices will be teleported onto them. The only piece of the equipment that can be removed is the head piece. 

There are two device sets, one for Stacy and one for Ethan. Stacy's is keyed to a woman and so other characters could walk into the delivery space and not get the device. The other will only be seen by Ethan. He could accidentally walk into the space or act on impulse after Stacy gets her equipment.

This means that we have a window-of-opportunity campaign. A back up plan must be developed in case the players fail.

The woman who is destined for the device:

"We See Go You Stop Not" The words are clumsily formed and halting

After the device is taken, the aliens will try to muster any forces they can and the players will have to play back across town to home.
