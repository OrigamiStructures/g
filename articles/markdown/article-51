# CCtoCV: The Fighter's Quest for Level 2

A fighter's abilities come from an alien device that works in the way a robotic exoskeleton does. However, since the aliens have technology that allow them to control the natural world in much more sophisticated ways than human technology, there is no need for armatures, braces, straps, motors, and hinges. Instead the fighter wears a series of metal bands that enhance their strength, agility, and prowess with weaponry.

This set of bands must be stolen from a facility where they are manufactured. Once the bands are on on a person, they cannot be transferred to another. So the only time to acquire the device is after manufacture and before an ownership claim.

This means that we have a window-of-opportunity campaign. A back up plan must be developed in case the players fail.
