# Pieces: Funtional and Presentational 

## Stacks, rendering, and API delivery

At the current point in the code I've written ArtworkStacks, all of the RolodexCard hierarchy (except Users), and the ArtistManifests.

I designed and wrote these from a presentation perspective; trying to solve the problem of delivering one predictable data object that was sufficient in any page rendering scenario we might have.

These objects would then be convenient API delivery packages. We could use the API packages to reproduce system behavior in mobile apps and third parties would have objects that were comprehensive for a data structure. 
With one or more, they would have enough data to create new behaviors in new environments.

## Creeping functionality

While writing ArtistManifests, functional concerns started to move to the forefront.

The Issuer of the manifest is transforming a simple Member record into an Artist, opening the record to a vast array of system activity. They are simultaneously granting data access rights to some other user. The basic components composed into the manifest identify display units—Members and Artworks primarily—and that allowed page rendering. But there are fields and records that control details of data access for the manager and  others that control exposure of one manager to another.

Still, this is primarily data for presentation. We're just supporting a new layer of logic before display and laying the foundation for interactions between system users.

## Primarily functional objects

Pieces have a small presentation footprint. They are represented a counts when rendering artwork information pages. And in the case of a unique work, it feels to the user as though the piece is the whole story.

An it is likely that a suite of images will accumulate in some cases to document the actual piece being represented.

But the piece record has only two main data points that describe it directly. And of those, only one is used for each piece. Numbered editions use the `number` field and open editions use the `quantity` field.

### Un-numbered pieces

The `quantity` field points directly to the dominant functional role of Piece objects. This value represents some group of pieces in a common disposition state. It is the result of processes carried out by Artist Managers and is fluid over time, able to both increase and decrease withing a range set in the Edition/Format.

A "piece" described by its quantity value does not represent anything fixed in the real world. It represents the number of items in a common state.

### Numbered pieces

Superficially, it seems that numbered pieces—described by `number` rather than `quantity`—do represent real world objects. However, the labeling of any given real-world piece with a number label is an arbitrary act that could change for any number of reasons.

Because of this reality, the Piece actually stands as the identifier of a particular history of events.

If we have images and dispositions linked to piece_id = 55 with number = 3, then those images and that history of activity describe piece 3. Simply performing an edit—number = 12—and relabeling the real world piece to 12, changes these facts. Now the images are of #12 and the events happened to #12.

### Piece function

So there are two functional roles of a piece object.

1. Track the populations that exist in specific states.
2. Attach documentation and histories to specific labeled individuals.

Recognizing that a population may be one individual, and that a state described by a disposition is the base component of a history, we see these two functions as closely related.
