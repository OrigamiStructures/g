# Open edition piece management during disposition changes

## The situation, a piece fragmentation case study

For numbered editions, each piece always has its own record and will accumulate a unique disposition history.

Un-numbered (open) editions start with a single piece record that represents all the pieces. The piece has a `quantity` value to identify the size of the edition.

Consider the case of an un-numbered edition of 30. It would have one piece record with qty = 30.

If 10 pieces are loaned for an event, 
- the main piece has its quantity reduced by 10
- a new piece with quantity 10 is created
- the new piece is linked to a disposition recording the loan.

When the work returns, 
- the loan disposition is marked as closed.
- if some storage disposition is desired it is created and linked to the piece   
  This gives the piece (qty=10) a disposition history and permanently isolates it from the main piece-pool

If, at the event a piece was sold,
- the loan-block of pieces has its quantity reduced to 9
- a new piece (qty = 1) is created
- the new piece is linked to a disposition
- this new piece lacks all the disposition history of its previous companions

When the loan returns, the piece (qty = 9) gets a new disposition.

### Against fragmentation 

Any attempt to maintain piece/disposition history is going to be complex in this environment. And one of the core ideas behind open/un-numbered editions is that their individual pieces are fully interchangeable.

The fragmentation that occurs to the piece record set is unnecessary and inconvenient. And since piece records exist to establish unique piece identity and history, they are of limited value for un-numbered editions.

### Broken links

But the pieces weren't merged back to the main group through record deletion and quantity change because this would leave orphan dispositions. Without a piece link, there would be no way to associate these events with any particular artwork.

## A new path

Some form of addition link or re-linking of dispositions for un-numbered editions is needed.

And this will mean further nuance in the ArtStack entities.

The dispositions could gain a link to the edition or format.

The disposition could be relinked to a proxy piece of no quantity that becomes the parent of all dispositions for the edition's pieces

The piece that originally links the disposition could remain as its permanent link but its quantity could be zeroed. This option might maintain some sense of continuity for the edition's disposition history since paired events like a loan/return would have a common parent. But there is no reason at this point to assume we would need this continuity.
