# Open edition piece management during disposistion changes

## The situation, a piece fragmentation case study

For numbered editions, each piece always has its own record and will accumulate a unique disposition history.

Un-numbered (open) editions start with a single piece record that represents all the pieces. It has a `quantity` value to identify the size of the edition.

If 10 pieces are loaned for an event, 
- the main piece has its quantity reduced by 10
- a new piece with quantity 10 is created
- the new piece is linked to the disposition.

When the work returns, 
- a new disposition is created.   
  This gives the piece (qty=10) a disposition history and permanently isolates it from the main piece-pool

If, at the event a piece was sold,
- the loan-block of pieces has its quantity reduced to 9
- a new piece (qty = 1) is created
- the new piece is linked to a disposition

When the loan returns, the piece (qty = 9) gets a new disposition.
