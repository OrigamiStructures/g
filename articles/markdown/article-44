### Inertial shirt

### Exoskeletons

Q can make lightweight exoskeleton systems that increase strength for a limited time (based on battery power). The system can also generate some deflection fields for different purposes, but at the cost of battery power.

The deflection fields will introduce the players to the concept of inertialy tuned repulsion fields so they could learn that bullet proof barriers may be penetrated at different speeds. 

The batteries are produced from expensive, large li-ion batteries so the players can buy at heavy cost, or steal batteries. It takes some many resources to do the job (or some other limiting factor, like an unobtainable finite resource provided by the aliens) that not everyone can have a set of armor. Or, other smaller highly desirable devices could be made, forcing choices.

### Tin Foil Hats

The aliens have devices that, when placed to surround an area, create a zone of motivation suppression. This is how they can operate at water tower sites over a period of town without detection by the neighbors.

However, the effect can't penetrate aluminum, so a simple tin-foil hat protects the players. In the absence of a hat, they need to do wisdom saving throws to operate.

In the act of blocking the field the aluminum heats up. So the players either need to fashion heat sinks for the hats (which prevents covering them up and makes them more ridiculous) or they must take them on and off (or take fire damage). Of course, when they take them off they have to wisdom save to stay on task.

## Equipment

- Healer's Kit

## Devices

### Motivation suppressors

These devices are placed in a perimeter around some location. Inside the perimeter, human and animal motivations are suppressed. There are other devices that can nullify the effect, so an inner perimeter can be set up creating a work area.

As an alternative, aluminum will negate the field, so a tin-foil hat will protect players or NPCs

### Activity screens

These devices are placed in a perimeter around a limited area of activity. It works as a visual screen for some activity.

My first idea was that it only screens a band of space, so as the players pass through they can see activity, but once through, it's invisible again. This is pretty interesting
