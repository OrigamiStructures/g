# CCtCV Locations

## Warehouse
- for assembly of artifacts and storage
- This could have actual employees that don't know what they are making and co-opted specialists (or actual aliens) that incorporate the neural material in an end process   
   This presents a nice opportunity to have Restricted Areas that can be penetrated for gruesome discoveries and defended by alien forces.

## Underground tunnel compounds
- Tunnels appear to be raw, reinforced dirt. They have a circular cross section. 
- What must happen here that can't happen elsewhere (like a warehouse/factory)?
  - The aliens should live here. This would be in the 10" tunnels and a possible goal for the players would be to force them out for a fight or find a way to destroy them in place   
     Breach the tunnels from above ground and pump concrete in? 
  - Before the alien foothold is strong enough, the tunnels would be a base of operation for material storage and manufacturing. This means, depending on when the players arrive, they may find ongoing operations or abandoned facilities
