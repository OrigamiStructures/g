# Dispositions

A Disposition describes the condition of some population of pieces as being at some state in the real world.

The current schema in dispositions provides far more data points than are required for this limited task.

And, considering the fact that the 'piece' may be a record tracking the number of virtual pieces in the population, the use of a join table from Disposition to Piece represents a dynamic, fuzzy description rather than a concrete mapping.
