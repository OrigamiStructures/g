# The Puzzling Nature of Formats

Formats are currently treated as the third of 4 levels of abstraction for a "artwork".

## Three of 4 levels of abstraction

The system considers Artwork to be a containing abstraction for one bit of the artist's intellectual property. 

This makes little sense if you think about a painting as an artwork; or a sculpture. But when you consider the possibility of producing prints of a painting or casting reproductions of a sculpture, you can immediately understand the term Artwork as used in the system. It is the marketable idea. A painting is one realization of that idea; an Edition. The prints are another realization, another Edition of the same Artwork.

So, Edition is the second level of abstraction.

At the bottom of this chain of abstractions we arrive at the Piece. This represents some real-world product. It may be a painting (an edition of 1) or a photograph in an edition of 50.

Pieces are the objects that are called Artwork in a system that doesn't acknowledge editions.

## Formats: The Problem Child

The abstraction between Edition and Piece is Format. 

Artwork is the common ancestor, Edition describe how many pieces are produced in a run, Format describes the physical characteristics of the pieces, and Piece tracks the individual saleable/showable objects.

On first examination, the Format seems unnecessary except as some descriptive information. A new Format could be considered to be a new Edition in most cases.

There is one specific editioning approach that photographers sometime employ. They may commit to an edition of 50 for some photograph but offer that work in any of several sizes. Whatever combination of sizes they sell, they will close the edition at 50. In this case they have one edition and 3 formats for the pieces.

Consider another possible use of Format. You are a watercolorist and have any number of paintings available. You sell these as-is, matted, or matted and framed and you would like to track these different outcomes as you track sales of the works. Formats provide the solution.


### Problems with Formats

In the current implementation Formats have several weaknesses.

- Format belongsTo Edition and aren't available in other Artwork creation contexts. So they're not reusable. Edition creation events forces the user to also define one or more Format even when an identical Format exists.
- While they are intended to carry physical format data, they provide no flexibility to describe the many kinds of works that might exist.
- As the carriers of format (and media) data, they should provide a smooth path to documenting pieces, the production of wall cards, prospectuses and such. They fail in this role.
- The need for multiple Formats on an Edition is limited, but the insertion of Formats in the abstraction chain is universal so the majority of Artworks have unnecessary complexity
- Pieces are generated automatically when the Edition quantity is set. After this automatic process, a detailed assignment to a Format is required as a hand process.
 
## A possible meta-data approach

It might be possible to convert Format into a meta-data pool. Some structure can store the user (or system) defined descriptions of object structure, material, and size.

When an Edition is defined, Formats are selected as a being available options for Pieces of that Edition.

When Pieces are disposed, the selection of a Format is enforced.

For Editions in a single format, Format selection for the Piece would be automatic and transparent.

For artists who define on Format in their main pool, Formats would become fully transparent.

## Schema changes for the meta-data approach

Currently Formats force a branching level into the Artwork and group Pieces in a way that must always be addressed in rendering:

By breaking the belongsTo link Format->Edition, Formats can become reusable. They can be linked to Pieces late without impact on page render or Piece grouping in the rendered views.

An alternate strategy removes the Piece->Format linking altogether and links Format to a specific Disposition of the Piece. That would allow a photograph to be disposed to a show framed, then after return, disposed to a gallery placement or sale unframed.

This has the advantage of making the Piece records completely stable after creation. It does however put important meta-data describing the piece one step away and would put additional pressure on the stack objects responsible for providing data to rendering code. And would generally increase the logic required to compile a fill description of the pieces as delivered.

If alternate states for a single piece need to be tracked across dispositions, it might be possible to work out a secondary 'format' link while using the Piece->Format link to identify the piece production details.

## Content of a Format

I see some kind of assembled data structure for formats to provide user with modular and repeatable options.
- Lists of possible media
- Possible dimension sets
- Process or construction description
