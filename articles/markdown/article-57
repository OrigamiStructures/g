# Stacks, Layers, Single Members, and Primary

All uses will respond to these properties if they are set. However, the pagination is done for the data received at the level that called `load( )`. For example, if you call StackSet::load( ) all the StackEntity and Layer processes will run and the final accumulation of all those results will be paginated. If Layer::load( ) is called, the result from that one layer will be paginated.

- $_page
- $_limit

This property is ignored during Layer::load( ) calls (because it can be deduced), required for StackEntity::load( ), and optional for StackSet::load( ). When present in StackSet::load( ) it will determine whether the entities from some layer are filtered and returned for accumulation. When missing at this level, the StackEntities will be returned and no filtering will be done. 

- $_layer

These are values that determine result filtering. They only work when a the $_layer property is set or deduced. Three of these properties must be set. Either $_property or $_method are set to determine the source of the value to test. $_test_value provides the value to test against. $_match will determine what kind of comparison to perform. $_match can be == or !=. True will return the entity, false will not.

In a case where both $_property and $_method are set, $_property will be used.

If $property or $_method is set without both $_test_value and $_match, filtering will be ignored.

- $_property
- $_method
- $\_test\_value
- $_match
