# CCtoCV Encounter notes 1/27

## Stirge

[Stirge specs](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/stirge)

- ***Body:*** Cedar Waxwing
- ***Head:*** Some kind of skin stretched over manufactured components to create some kind of syringe device. Vials inside the tiny 'head', might have been empty or not.   
  (before they were broken, one contained a sedative and the other was empty to accept a blood sample. The head also had a mechanism to take tissue samples.
- ***Inside head:*** Besides the devices inside the head, there is a white, fibrous nodule with many threads and cords extending down into the body and to various point in the device parts. This is one of the neural modules the aliens make to control their devices.   
   Its tendrils will reach out to other nearby organisms if their original host is non-functional. If they can attache, they will compel the new target to take up the original task. Success will depend on the task and the nature of the new creature relative the the original.   
   Usually, the results are clumsy and ineffective. The complexity needed to control a more complex creature won't be in the nodule. On the other hand a simpler creature won't have a brain that can process more complex instructions

### Perception

- <=10   
  A bird body with some kind of altered head shaped like a long cone and covered with some smooth material
- 11 - 15  
  A bird whose head has been replaced with what looks like a wire armature covered in what looks like skin from something.
- 16 or higher
   A cedar waxwing body with a skin covered head attached. The head is a wire framework surrounding other parts of unknown purpose.

### Investigation

Investigation rolls include the Perception information and add more

- <= 10   
  The head is so damaged you can't really identify anything that was in it but you see some metal parts, broken glass and some white stuff.

- 11 - 15  
   You can see small parts inside the head, something like a syringe needle running into the cone at the front and some white fibrous material in with all the other internal parts. Those parts look like small metal components

- 16 or higher
   You can see mechanisms inside and glass vials that have broken. There is liquid and blood on the vials and you wonder if one held something to inject and one held extracted blood because the mechanism looks like it attaches to a syringe needle that goes out the front of the cone. There is also a white, fibrous knot inside with strings reaching into the mechanism and down into the body. There are other fibers that are moving.

### Touching it 

- With a stick will start the nodule grabbing the stick
- Picking up the bird will trigger a Dex saving roll
   - <=10 the nodule attaches and pulls away on your hand
   - <= 14 the nodule attaches and pulls away but you shake it off
   - 15 or greater saves

### Attached

Constitution saving throw

- <= 14 you grab the head and have a compulsion to stab the pony which you proceed to attempt, re-roll each turn
- > 14 you feel a compulsion to grab the head and stab the pony but with a wave of revulsion you knock the nodule off your hand and anyone within 5' mus make a dex save to avoid it.

### Effects of touching a downed Stirge

The head is assumed to have broken open and that allows the neural mat to send out fibers to attache to any living being nearby.

## Post battle encounters

If they get the pony safely back in a paddock, Officer Friendly shows up to talk to them and will take both the stirges if they haven't been secured yet.

She'll question the players about their reason for being there and what they saw. She'll take notes and view their ID. She'll warn them off of meddling. but won't detain them if they behave.

If the pony is fled or dead, Kent Clarkson comes around to try and get information from them.
