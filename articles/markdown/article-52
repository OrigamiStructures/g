# CCtoCV: The Monk's Quest for Level 2

The monk's abilities are enabled by a neural patch which must be in contact with the skin at the base of the neck. It is held in this position by a short tippet.

![A tippet](/img/images/image/be8adc3e-e412-4501-aba6-45c409d635ea/tippet.jpg "An example of a long tippet")
A tippet that is about twice the length of a monks tippet.


Once in contact, the neural patch will cling to the skin as long as the wearer is conscious. This means if a monk is knocked unconscious, their tippet (and so their powers) can be stolen. This is the way the monk can acquire their powers.

An unmodified human is not going to be able to subdue the wearer of a monk's tippet, so the only ways to gain one, is to have a powerful ally win a battle against a monk, or to kill one.
