# Policy: Illegal Content

Excerpt from chat discussion

>*Don Drake:*
>>	Fascinating open source problem
>>	https://apple.news/Av2yttGYERAGTVOrfUNKBwA
>>	Glad I don’t have to deal with it
>>	But it gives pause. An api does create the possibility of public dissemination of stored content. How could that go wrong?
>>	It’s all to easy to imagine ways

>*Jason Tempestini:*
>>	I agree. I read an article yesterday about creating your own super small social network.
>>	One of the issues is policing. Which is why small size is so important. 
>>	But what if someone on the site is distributing prints of racist images. 

>*Don Drake:*
>>	Or child porn

>*Jason Tempestini:*
>>	Right. Crossing the line to illegal. Now we’re hosting child porn. 

>*Don Drake:*
>>	It’s a scary world
>>	And artists are notorious for pushing the boundaries 

>*Jason Tempestini:*
>>	Yeah. 
>>	That’s a whole research topic. How to police content. 
>>	I don’t think we can simply say we don’t. 

>*Don Drake:*
>>	But it mainly comes up through api implementation 
>>	The app is is pretty localized and private 
>>	We can see misuse by excess manager creation
>>	The only local content sharing method

>*Jason Tempestini:*
>>	I’m not sure that matters. 
>>	If we have that stuff on our site, even if it’s only accessible by the “artist” I think we’re still hosting illegal porn. 

>*Don Drake:*
>>	True. 
>>	There is a difference between a user that privately stores illegal content and having a system that can be leveraged to distribute illegal content

>*Jason Tempestini:*
>>	But, of course, ours is the latter.

## Is ClearStudio "a system that can be leveraged to distribute illegal content"?

ClearStudio is designed as an inventory management system. It is meant to map real-world objects to information about their status. And all this, centered around the concept of Artwork, Shows, Collectors, etc. 

It is not designed as a content sharing tool, or a content storage tool. 

The only 'content' it is designed to store is documentary information meant to help users identify real-world objects, and associate them with the data explaining the history and status of specific objects.
