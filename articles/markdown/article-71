# Policy: Illegal Content

Excerpt from chat discussion

>*Don Drake:*   
>>	Fascinating open source problem   
>>	[Mastadon article](https://apple.news/Av2yttGYERAGTVOrfUNKBwA)   
>>	Glad I don’t have to deal with it   
>>	But it gives pause. An api does create the possibility of public dissemination of stored content. How could that go wrong?   
>>	It’s all to easy to imagine ways   

>*Jason Tempestini:*   
>>	I agree. I read an article yesterday about creating your own super small social network.   
>>	One of the issues is policing. Which is why small size is so important.    
>>	But what if someone on the site is distributing prints of racist images.    

>*Don Drake:*   
>>	Or child porn   

>*Jason Tempestini:*   
>>	Right. Crossing the line to illegal. Now we’re hosting child porn.    

>*Don Drake:*   
>>	It’s a scary world   
>>	And artists are notorious for pushing the boundaries    

>*Jason Tempestini:*   
>>	Yeah.    
>>	That’s a whole research topic. How to police content.    
>>	I don’t think we can simply say we don’t.    

>*Don Drake:*   
>>	But it mainly comes up through api implementation    
>>	The app is is pretty localized and private    
>>	We can see misuse by excess manager creation   
>>	The only local content sharing method   

>*Jason Tempestini:*   
>>	I’m not sure that matters.    
>>	If we have that stuff on our site, even if it’s only accessible by the “artist” I think we’re still hosting illegal porn.    

>*Don Drake:*   
>>	True.    
>>	There is a difference between a user that privately stores illegal content and having a system that can be leveraged to distribute illegal content   

>*Jason Tempestini:*   
>>	But, of course, ours is the latter.   

## Is ClearStudio "a system that can be leveraged to distribute illegal content"?

ClearStudio is designed as an inventory management system. It is meant to map real-world objects to information about their status. And all this, centered around the concept of Artwork, Shows, Collectors, etc. 

It is not designed as a content sharing tool, or a content storage tool. 

The only 'content' it is designed to store is documentary information meant to help users identify real-world objects, and associate them with the data explaining the history and status of specific objects.

### Not to dodge the issue

This doesn't mean I want to abdicate responsibility for having policies that address abuse or illegal use of the site.

I actually see this distinction as a tool for policy making. Use of the site to distribute content could be one step along a road toward identifying prohibited site use.

## Privacy vs Secrecy

Since we are beginning with an assumption of Artist users, we can further assume that public dissemination of their work is a user goal. This could give us a way to make distinctions between private user data, and a user's desire to keep the pictorial documentation of their works secret.

If we made some kind of content-policing policies, we would want to be very explicit about where specific data falls withing the privacy/secrecy boundaries.

## Site Use vs API Implementation

Even if the site can be classified as something other than a content management and dissemination system, that may not be true for an API implementor's product. In fact, driving some 'works publication' process is a good candidate for an API use. 

So third party developers could make ClearStudio party to illegal (or objectionable) behavior. This would have to be addressed in the policies.

## Other Possible Abuses of ClearStudio

A user could set up an illicit content sharing system by storing images as documentation of 'artwork' and then creating a series of Managers that could see the content.

Addressing such unlikely, but technically possible, abuses is one goal of the policies.
