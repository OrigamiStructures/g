## other notes

- Creature encounters are used to draw the players to key location
  - For discovery of clues
  - To lead players to 'gateway' locations; places where they can transition into the alternate world
  - To lead players into boon items left by allies
  - To lead players to trap items that are left by agents of enemies to lead them astray or to fail them in critical situations
- A 'crazy' person NPC with a tin-foil hat can put the players on to protection from the motivation suppression fields.   
   Also, trailers, mobile homes, and other aluminum sided locations will suppress the field and this could give a clue.
