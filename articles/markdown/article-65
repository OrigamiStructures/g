# Structure of Format Join Records

There are a couple of competing requirements

## 5/13 Chat transcript

Jason Tempestini:
	Ok, are formats “potential” pieces?
Don Drake:
	how do you mean?
Jason Tempestini:
	Well, there’s a question, “What’s a format” or what is recorded in a format.
	My question is, where does a format fit in, as a record?
	Does a format describe a piece?
Don Drake:
	ok
	A format is a static record that stands alone
	it describes something about the physical construction of the artwork (pieces of an edition)
	when an edition is ‘made’ one are more formats are chosen from the available set.
	and a link is established to point to that format
	when pieces are made, each one gets linked to one of the formats that are available through the edition
	BUT
	besides the name of the format, provided by the Format record, there is data that will be used to fill out wall cards, prospectuses and what-not
	dimensions, materials, techniques
Jason Tempestini:
	Right. I literally contains the “format” data
	So, a format record is a potential piece record. Make a piece and select from the predefined formats
	The idea here is to make the creation of pieces consistent, right?
Don Drake:
	well….
	yes
	however
	right now my thinking is the piece record is a narrow counter/marker for the existence of some physical thing
	it points to a format. 
	the format describes that nature of the piece
	meta data on the piece
Jason Tempestini:
	Sure, I can see that.
	However
	I feel like the nature of art pieces is that this “format” can never be connected to more than one piece.
	As if any information changes about the format it would change all of the pieces.
	And it means the creation of a new format record any time you want to create a “custom” piece.
Don Drake:
	yes, that gets to the question I’m asking
	consider a Format: Silver Gelatin Print
	vs
	Format: 8x10 Silver Gelatin Print
Jason Tempestini:
	right
Don Drake:
	the first is more reusable but the second is required to describe a piece
	so, Format: name=Silver Gelatin Print, height = __, width =__
	how the hell do we start storing this in a repeatable, modular way
	when we also need 
	Format: Scuplture, marble
	no dimensions. or same dimensions plus others?
	every thing becomes crazy!
	The number of format records needs to be fairly short or it can overwhelm the user, but it needs to support tons of granular and repeatable variation so the artist can describe all their different stuff
	a bit baffeling. 
	your “never be connected to more than one piece” is the snapshot version
Jason Tempestini:
	Right, I hear that.
	So, you’re really creating a choice list system, that customizable.
	Here are the formats we’ve decided this artwork will be available in.
	There are media formats, size formats, process formats, etc.
	But, how to save those in records?
	oK
	Heresy below
	Ready?
Don Drake:
	ok
	that all sounds good
Jason Tempestini:
	I think we should just dump this and make it a part of the piece record.
	Maybe even as a description block.
	What is the advantage to the user of any other option?
Don Drake:
	a description block is a valid option
	added to the issue
	much simpler
Jason Tempestini:
	Yeah. I just can’t find a reason that we would need more granularity than that?
	I mean, a good full text search is going to be useful for us on many levels.
	And would provide the search ability of formats
Don Drake:
	just runs the risk of lower consistency and large numbers of almost-the-same data
	which can, in some instances, frustrate the user.
	but your search points are good too
Jason Tempestini:
	I hear you. That consistency is the main “pro” argument for formats.
	My issue is trying to figure out how to present these to the user in an accessible way.
Don Drake:
	right. if the system is too complicated it fails. and if it requires duplicate work, it also fails. 
	classic pincer movement. hahahahah
	The way I’m thinking about this is: What will solve the wall-card problem.
	Title, Artist, Media
	with media being a fuzzy description 
Jason Tempestini:
	Right. Media is almost always an “open” text area.
	I mean, I’m sure that the Louvre has some static categorization, but maybe not even there
Don Drake:
	Its a nuisance for the artist to think in this way when the requirement comes. I’d like the data to arise naturally through the use of the system 
	And a painter that always works in oil should have to do nothing more than add some size info when creating their 10th entry
	they shouldn’t even have to SAY oil, or painting or on canvas
Jason Tempestini:
	Right, but how does this “oil” artist identify themselves?
	Do they have a “major media” entry in their profile card?
Don Drake:
	that’s plausible
Jason Tempestini:
	I love the line “data to arise naturally” though, and I think I see what you man.
	mean.
	The system needs to gracefully learn from what the user has already done to offer guidance when they describe an thing again.
Don Drake:
	right



	recent wall card examples from a friends Facebook post
Jason Tempestini:
	Right
	How would we categorize that?
	They’re not a “type” of artist at all.
	Our only hope is a learning system, that when they type Ac wants to fill in Acrylic for them, of Sc offering Scratchboard
	I see something else there, too, which is an artwork title with an intentional line break.
Don Drake:
	hahhaha. yeah. fuzzy
	a profile including main options defined by artist (or selected from our suggested set)
	and room for on-the-fly creation of new stuff?
	The actual label presented as editable, pre-formatted text before final export/print?
Jason Tempestini:
	That last is a for sure.
	I think we might actually go so far as to create a word doc and export that
	And how would we present all the options in the artist card?
	Without dealing with Sammy Super Creative saying “what, catsup packets on used cardboard isn’t a media I can choose?”
Don Drake:
	yeah. it can’t only be our suggested data
	so, the system has to ‘see’ system data as public and user created data as private
	but if we right record analysis routines, we can detect common user-created solutions and add them to the system choices
	privacy disclaimer. hahahahah!
Jason Tempestini:
	No privacy disclaimer necessary, in my mind. We only analyze the user’s own data for their tips.
	We don’t want to present what everyone chooses after they type “ge” but, rather, what YOU normally type.
Don Drake:
	Sammy Super Creative 😜
Jason Tempestini:
	One of our “model” users. 
Don Drake:
	hahahah!
