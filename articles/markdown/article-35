## Foundational concepts, strategy, theory and speculation
- [How fine-grain should stack classes be?](/article/how-fine-grain-should-stack-classes-be "How fine-grain should stack classes be?")  
    This article lays out the goals for stack objects. It also lays out explicit guidelines for when new sub-unit of a stack should be designed.

## APIs and use guides
- [Interacting with Layer Objects](/article/interacting-with-layer-objects "Interacting with Layer Objects")  
   This is the object type of the properties of stack entities. The entity interface is specifically designed to expect and make use of these objects
- [Interacting with StackEntities](/article/interacting-with-stackentities "Interacting with StackEntities")  
    StackEntity is the base class for the many concrete stack entity types (UserStack, ArtStack, ArtistStack, etc)  
    This class extends Entity. It adds new methods to interact with its properties of type **Layer**
- [Interacting with StackSet Objects.](/article/interacting-with-stackset-objects "Interacting with StackSet Objects.")  
    StackSet is the collection objects for sets of StackEntity objects. Its interface extends the **Layer** interface tools up one more level.
