# Guidelines for writing StackTable classes

[Stacks Portal](/article/stacks-portal "Stacks Portal")
 

The new table class must extend App\Model\Table\StackTables

Set the three protected properties:

- $layerTables
   - a list of the tables that you need to appear as properties of this table; Associations

```php
// will be available as $this->Members etc
$layerTables = [
	'Users', 
	'Members', 
	'Contacts', 
	'Addresses', 
	'Artists', 
	'GroupsMembers'
	];
```

-  $stackSchema
   - setting a property to type 'layer' will make the entity automatically convert the array data to a Layer object  
   - normally the table schema becomes the entity schema. Since there is no table for these stacks you have to define your entity schema  
```php
$stackSchema = 	[	
	['name' => 'user', 'specs' => ['type' => 'layer']],
	['name' => 'member', 'specs' => ['type' => 'layer']],
	['name' => 'contacts', 'specs' => ['type' => 'layer']],
	['name' => 'addresses', 'specs' => ['type' => 'layer']],
	['name' => 'artists', 'specs' => ['type' => 'layer']],
	['name' => 'groups_members', 'specs' => ['type' => 'layer']],
];
```
- $seedPoints
   - each seed point represents a kind of entity that can be supported with full data context by the stack. Each one you name will have to be supported by a method that discovers the stack needed for that record. 
  - Naming the seeds in both singular and plural form means you don't have to remember which way to use when you call.

```php
$seedPoints = [
	'disposition', 'dispositions', 'piece', 
	'pieces', 'format', 'formats', 'edition', 
	'editions', 'artwork', 'artworks', 'series',
];
```
