# Rolodex Cards: A Major Stack Heirarchy

Rolodex Cards start from the simplest composite assembly around a Member record and proceed up to the most detailed and feature rich system User.

![Diagram showing the layers that are added to the entity structure by each subsiquent Table class](/img/images/image/f861007e-a713-441a-acdd-902a23df82ea/RolodexHeirarchy.png "Rolodex Table Heirarchy")

**Diagram needs to be updated. Artist and User won't inherit**

As can be seen in the diagram, every variety of Rolodex Card has an Identity (alias of Member) and may be a member of one or more groups, hence its Memberships layer. Finally, every card has a layer describing the owner of the record, a registered system User.

This last layer may seem redundant or unnecessary but it is important to remember that a registered user may grant management rights to artist data. And in this process, they may provide entries from their address book to aid in the process. So the cards available at any given time may be from a mix of sources and have different editing and use permissions. (This directly contradicts the behavior described in [Manager Permission](/article/manager-permission "Manager Permission"))

This basic card only serves as a platform. No concrete card type is fully described by it.

## Grouping types

### Category Cards

Category cards are simple groups that can help organize user data in named sets. They can have members (their defining characteristic) and, as all other Member records, they be be members.

### Organization Cards

Organizations have all the characteristics of Categories but since they represent real-world entities, they can also have address and various types of contacts (email, phone, etc)

Organizations can also participate in Artwork Disposition events. Organizations may be exhibition venues, galleries, storage facilities or any other possible disposition participant.

## Non-Grouping Types

###Person Cards

Person cards have all the features of Organization Cards except they cannot have members. They also add an Image to the data to allow a more personalized user experience.

## Functional Types

The future of the last two concrete types, Artist and User, are uncertain because at this point there is a shift from 'presentational' to 'functional' cards. 

### Artist Cards

Artist cards represent the Members that produce Artworks. These may be registered system Users or Artists may be created and managed by a system user that is not the person named in the Member/Artist record.

Artist cards also name the Users authorized to manage their works. And they contain links to detailed information about the rights of those managers to view, create, and edit records for the artist.

### User Cards

These represent registered system users. It is likely that only one full card at a time and that one represents the active user. 

The distillers for this card look unnecessary given this likely use of the record. more to be revealed.
