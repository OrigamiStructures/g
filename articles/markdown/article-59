# Rolodex Cards: A Major Stack Heirarchy

Rolodex cards represent the various kinds of person, organization, and grouping Member record in the system.

**Diagram needs to be updated. Artist and User won't inherit**

As can be seen in the diagram, every variety of Rolodex Card has an Identity (alias of Member) and may be a member of one or more groups, hence its Memberships layer. Finally, every card has a layer describing the owner of the record, a registered system User. (This may be moved to be the Supervisor, a different way of describing the User)

This last layer may seem unnecessary, and there is ongoing thought about possible security risks. Some form of this data is needed because a registered user may grant management rights to artist data. And in this process, they may provide entries from their address book to aid in the process. So the cards available at any given time may be from a mix of sources and have different editing and use permissions. (This directly contradicts the behavior described in [Manager Permission](/article/manager-permission "Manager Permission"))

This basic card only serves as a platform. No concrete card type is fully described by it.

## Grouping types

### Category Cards

Category cards are simple groups that can help organize user data in named sets. They can have members (their defining characteristic) and, as all other Member records, they be be members.

### Organization Cards

Organizations have all the characteristics of Categories but since they represent real-world entities, they can also have address and various types of contacts (email, phone, etc)

Organizations can also participate in Artwork Disposition events. Organizations may be exhibition venues, galleries, storage facilities or any other possible disposition participant.

## Non-Grouping Types

###Person Cards

Person cards have all the features of Organization Cards except they cannot have members. They also add an Image to the data to allow a more personalized user experience.

## Other objects that include RolodexCard instances

Originally Artist and User were imaged to be subtypes of PersonCard. But it seems better that they compose in the needed PersonCard but don't extend the class. They will probably have mostly *behavioral/functional* roles in the system. The Cards will be *presentational* support objects for the most part.

### Artists

Artist cards represent the Members that produce Artworks. These may be registered system Users or Artists may be created and managed by a system user that is not the person named in the Member/Artist record.

Artist cards also name the Users authorized to manage their works. And they contain links to detailed information about the rights of those managers to view, create, and edit records for the artist.

### Supervisors

These represent registered system users. It is likely that only one full card at a time and that one represents the active user. 

### Manager

### Participant

Participant objects are an idea that would remove the Disposition layer from RolodexCards.

#### Dispositions and Tasks

As I was building the ManifestStack and placing the three PersonCards in the stack (Supervisor, Manager, Artist) it felt like the dispositions in those cards was unnecessary weight. Those cards were place in the object for presentation tasks. Would we want to show disposition data along with name/location/contact? Unlikely.

This is a tough question. Disposition data allows Institution and Person cards to be characterized in various ways (as collectors for example). This characterization could be important in organizing displays, highlighting important records, or filtering data.

Also, if we have any task-management features (alerting the user to pending shows, shipments, or other obligations) those tasks would stem from Dispositions. Having dispositions generally available on the cards would make the tasks follow the relevant players.
