## Travelers

The travelers are actually quite small and not at all strong. They do have the power to control the endocrine system of other beings to such a degree it seems like mind control. But a hit or two will take them out... if you can master yourself.

They lay down mats of underground fibers—like fungus threads—and by touching the end node on a network, they can cause chemicals to emit at various places. These chemicals have a powerful effect on the recipient.

This is their form of communication.

### Enemy motivation

The enemies have no actual interest in earth, its residents, or anything else. They have just were just traveling from point A to point B with a planned stop-off at a staging area to carry out refueling and arcane rights because the A-to-B distance/dimensional shift was too great for a single step.

These beings had no idea there would be a civilization at this location and barely understand the nature of the place they've come to. So, while they do figure out that they must stay hidden, and even figure out ways to take advantage of human weakness to further their own plans, these interactions are not their goal. They just need to rebuild their resources and accomplish their magical tasks in order to move on to their final destination.
