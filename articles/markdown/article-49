# CCtCV Aliens

## Notes for developing the aliens

Make a basic set of entity capabilities then a modification for each cohort, and finally an ability for the harmonious thread.

Unique behavioral characteristics for each cohort (talking about engagement and defense triggers; what do they see as a threat).

Individuals may only be semi-conscious though autonomous.

Based on alien organization patterns, what mistaken strategies will they try to pursue in their manipulation of humans? (manipulations they view as 'negotiations' or 'mollifications')

## Travelers

The travelers are actually quite small and not at all strong. They do have the power to control the endocrine system of other beings to such a degree it seems like mind control. But a hit or two will take them out... if you can master yourself.

They lay down mats of underground fibers—like fungus threads—and by touching the end node on a network, they can cause chemicals to emit at various places. These chemicals have a powerful effect on the recipient.

This is their form of communication.

### Enemy motivation

The enemies have no actual interest in earth, its residents, or anything else. They have just were just traveling from point A to point B with a planned stop-off at a staging area to carry out refueling and arcane rights because the A-to-B distance/dimensional shift was too great for a single step.

These beings had no idea there would be a civilization at this location and barely understand the nature of the place they've come to. So, while they do figure out that they must stay hidden, and even figure out ways to take advantage of human weakness to further their own plans, these interactions are not their goal. They just need to rebuild their resources and accomplish their magical tasks in order to move on to their final destination.

### The Harmonious Thread

[I'm not sure of the context of this note. Is it describing the way the characters perceive the aliens and the Harmonious Thread?]   
A ubiquitous presence (but unrecognized) in all conflicts and interactions. Appears to be a base aspect of the aliens but the capability/trait turns out to be a foreshadowing of an awesome power.

Though the Harmonious Thread 'knows' activities of all cohorts and issues coordinating orders, it is also a divided consciousness.

It has separate perceptual/interface modules for the different reporting cohorts and an integrating 'module' that synthesizes the somewhat abstracted results of its analysis.

The Thread is actually a composite entity that has evolved from a traditional cohort. Its present form cannot be subdivided though. It is truly a single organism now.

But because it originated in the far past as 16 individual organisms, it is not now a single consciousness. The sub-consciousnesses though are not self aware; rather they are subsumed.

The decision making node has no true perception of external reality as we understand it because it has no perception organs like eyes, ears, etc. It receives impression signals from the 4 cohorts, integrates this information and outputs decisions/instructions back to them.

--

(These notes still apply but)   
The Harmonious Thread is the merged evolution of the 4 different cohorts. This means it has (or is) a 4 lobed decision making 'brain'.

This brain takes input from all the cohort 'Firsts'.

The vestigial consciousnesses from the primordial cohort acts as input for the other cohort members should they need to communicate (a rare enough event).

### The Legendary Cohort

** Historians (cultural ecologists)

They view the civilization and its major sub units as organisms and tell the story of history as the story of an evolving ecology.

Because of this perspective, they don't view 'individuals' in the same way as humans do. They see populations rather than individuals because no cohort member ever has an existence or acts outside its group. They live in a neural-chemical/quantum haze of unity and can't comprehend the concept of independent will.

*** Its unclear how to explain the rogue entities actions ***

#### Locations of Activity

Anywhere a significant milestone event is taking place

### The Mollifier's Cohort

Because the advancement of the organisms civilization impacts all other systems in the ecology, mollifiers atone for the imbalances to create a real or perceived redressment.

#### Locations of Activity

Places with round features

### The Actor's Cohort

**Fabrications, Manufacturers**

They build all macroscopic objects and molecular components.

#### Location of activity

Device assembly and installation sites. But the Actors don't travel above ground except in extreme need. The maintain a remote presence at above ground sites when necessary, but leave the operations to be run by humans when possible.
