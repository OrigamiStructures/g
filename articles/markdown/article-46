### Mona Guzman

son [Gustavo](#gustavo-guzman)

Age 45, attractive divorced Latina, born in Chicago--left town for the Bay area in 2012 months after her oldest son, Luis, was murdered in a drug deal gone bad in Pilsen. Mona is a very distant relative of Joaquin Archivaldo Guzman, the drug kingpin, and she tried her best to keep her sons out of that world.

Early on in Cali, Mona made a 30% stake investment in a Cherryland business, the La Raza Market on 164th ave & E.14th street, and is now getting a decent monthly $$ return-- allowing her to only need to work part time as a hospice nurse. She has a volatile but passionate relationship with a union Ironworker/biker dude in North Oakland. Mona stays up there 4-5 days a week. She rents the little shack @ 18698 Crest Ave primarily for her son Gustavo to live somewhat independently of her.

### Gustavo Guzman

mother [Mona](#mona-guzman)

Now age 23, had a rough start in california, and spent 2 years in JV hall after assaulting one of his San Lorenzo High teachers, slicing off half his ear with a switchblade.
Gus is slender but muscular @ 5' 11". His dominant features are dark brown eyes and a "uni-brow" that he's oddly proud of and grooms regularly. His hoops hero is Anthony Davis of the NOLA Pelicans. He is obsessed with new congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, and writes love letters to her twice a month (with no reply)

Gustavo is glad to live in NorCAL, and has left the pain of his brother's death behind in Chicago. He's grateful for his mom's attention and support.  He works half-time as a UPS driver out of Oakland airport, and is a small time dealer of "Thai Stick" which his mom is unaware of..makes a few hundred bucks a month extra. He does recognize the risks are less now that weed is de-criminalized in the state. 

### Luke Lefkow

Age 22 served time in JV after getting caught selling meth to a strung out social worker who snitched to save her job/ alameda county pension. Luke's parents, both hard working russian immigrants, disowned him and left the US to open up a Popeye's Chicken franchise in a Moscow suburb.

Luke is a tall, 6' 2" fair faced weto with bowed legs, always clad in orange construction boots. He is an accomplished computer geek and gamer, dabbled in crypto-currency, made several thousand bucks & got out. He pays Gus's mom a few hundred bucks a month to crash @ Crest ave a few days a week. He has a a lady fuck-friend (Audrey Spamo) in Hayward who he's quite smitten with, despite her affliction of Tourette's Syndrome.. Audrey intersperses normal conversation with screaming expletives. Her favorite movie is "The Exorcist" from the 70's. 

An adrenaline junkie, Luke hooked up with an Auto theft ring on International Blvd.in  East Oakland. After a few months of effort, he cracked the main computer codes of two late model  vehicles; Cadillac Escalades and Subaru Forresters. It takes Luke approximately 6 minutes at close range to disable the alarms, open the vehicles, start the engines and drive off. Once a month, he gathers up Gus and Frankie Fish and they hijack 3 vehicles and drop them to the chop shop owner, only known as "Amos Moses". Amos hands Luke 4K cash for an Escalade and $2500 for a Subaru.

Luke is proud to announce to anyone in his slightly Russian accent, " I am successful independant contractor!" 

### Franklin "Frankie Fish" Banks

Age 24, is of Native American heritage (Ohlone), olive skinned, dark haired, about 5' 7" in height. He went to Juvie as a teen-ager after dropping a bowling ball from an overpass into 580 traffic, nailing a CHP vehicle. The officers were only slightly injured. Frankie Fish's grandfather Russell Banks, was a famous leader of the Indian occupation of the island of Alcatraz in SF bay in the 1970's. Frankie is immersed in his ethnicity & culture

Frankie Fish's day job is as a part-time, on-call care-giver for wealthy senior citizens in Piedmont and Danville. He enjoys the work, and truly believes that elders need love and respect. Frankie Fish also makes careful & thoughtful selections of pilfering items of expensive jewelry from his clients, selling them later for cash.

Gus and Luke love Frankie's quiet strength and his fierce belief in "The Mystical." Frankie ingests peyote or magic mushrooms once a month at a retreat in the sierra foothills with other young native-americans, drumming, chanting and chilling. In 2018, Frankie Fish sold a stolen star sapphire brooch for $4,500 and bought a used trailer, where he resides in Castro Valley, behind the parking lot of the Main Library. He comes up to Crest ave frequently to visit and party with his blood brothers. Frankie claims whenever he wears his Golden State Warriors jersey he begins to have visions of mammals & birds of prey being direct descendants of ancient aliens.
