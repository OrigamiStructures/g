# The Problem of Images

## Association strategies

My tentative plan is to make join tables for image-related table. 

However, if the image-related tables used uuid key fields we could get away with a single join table and stack layer. Worth considering.

Whichever path we take, to remain sane we're going to have to insure one image, one use. If another use is needed for the image, the image and record should be cloned and linked. NO REUSE!

### No reuse?

If we make edits (particularly deletions) operate on the links, couldn't multiple use work? The interface should be able to make things straight forward... he said confidently.

## From a use-case perspective

I'm not even sure how the artworks will be presented to the user at this point. The nested Artwork-to-Pieces pattern is unlikely to survive.

Without this, what screen uses for the images will there be?

And what other uses will the user need? Not having an art business I'm feeling unqualified to provide an answer. And that's a big problem for the project.

- Publishing to social media
   - Implies linkage through APIs
- Attachment to email
   - Email templates?
   - Select-able text node export too?
- Export to file system for transfer or publishing tasks
   - Sales prospectus
   - Cold proposal for a show
   - Rep solicitation
   - Press release
- Output in paper documentation for insurance
   - This means the system could act as a home inventory tool 
- System page, PDF, or print report
   - Shipping manifest
   - Loan inventory report
   - Collector or venue inventory
   - Disposition inventory
- Provenance documentation 

- Identify available numbered piece for sale
- Identify an available number across a set of editions
- Gather an arbitrary set of editions for some work
   - Finding a series or portfolio are two 'organized' sets, but then transporting and taking action on the members should happen as on any arbitrary set.
- Gather an arbitrary set of pieces for some work
   - like the edition item above, this is all about transporting and taking action on the found set, however it is found.


## Interface presentation

The list above helps clear some things up. It has at least broken the granular million-option thinking I get into.

The main goal is to get an image up for the work. The layer-linkage is irrelevant to the user. In fact, the layer-linkage may be different depending on the nature of the edition that is being created.

- If the user is creating a unique work, the image should be on the piece. All presentations of that work would be flat and the image used.
   - tools would be available for additional piece-linked images
   - the screen interface could be divided to distinguish the hero shots of the work from other documenting detail shots. In this case, heros go to edition and others to piece.   
   This feels like a good division and could help with selecting images for different uses. Piece images would be for insurance and provenance; edition images would be for marketing.
   - images HABTM pieces
- If a multi-piece edition is being made the image should go to the edition
   - Presentation of a multi-piece edition would always be from the edition context
   - tools for additional edition-linked images needed
   - deeper pages to document individual pieces needed
   - images HABTM editions
- If additional formats are created on an addition, tools are made available for format beauty shots are available but optional and ignored in normal screen presentation
   - format images would probably only be needed in publishing use cases.
   - images HABTM formats
- If a second edition is made for an artwork, the artwork layer gains tools to add images (with prompts explaining the role of the images. This would probably only be meaningful as a place to do multi-edition hero shots. They would be useful for multi-product marketing.
   - images HABTM artworks

As images accumulate for an artwork, a segregated gallery page will be needed for image management. It may be desirable to reuse images in different layers and this page would make it possible to do that.

- Dispostion reports should pull images from the available pool (probably favoring piece linked images as the default stance).   
   This may change for different report types
   - The image should link to the join entity? I think so.
   - images HABTM dispositionsPieces
