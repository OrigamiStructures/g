# Schema for Collaborative Projects

## Where things stand

The system is current 'one artist per artwork' and this will be the majority use case.

To be more specific, as of June 2019, the system has barely been moved off of the registered-use-as-artist original schema and onto a member-with-manifest-is-artist schema.

This new construction means all the old *table*.user_id links that indicated the artist for a work has been deprecated. 

As of this moment, only `artworks` table carries a link to the artist/member. All other artwork hierarchy tables are only linked to the user that created the data.

### Pending details of artist linking

No determination has been made about further linking of artwork related records to the artist. There is a strong case to be made that the edition should be linked. But linking formats and pieces seems unnecessary.

## Collaborations

Before a final determination about artist/artwork linking can be made, the question of collaborations must be considered.

### The conceivable collaboration scenarios

Here are the situations I can imagine and the basic linking requirements they imply:

- There is a single work or single edition that was a collaboration
   - artwork/artist linking is sufficient
- An artist has a work or edition they have created and create an additional edition as a collaboration
   - edition/artist linking would be required
- An artist has an edition and offers a special format that includes collaboration with another artist
   - artist/format linking would be required.

I think of a real world situation for that last one. Something along those lines could be a book or a book with a print. But that wouldn't really be a collaboration. Or a book and a hand tinted version which would be closer to a collaboration, but still not so much. 

Either of those could probably be handled by Format description data or, two editions (even if the quantities were kept fluid).

So, scratch that one.

And the first one would prevent the original artist from making a new non-collaboration edition once the Artwork was set as a collaboration.

So, scratch the first one.
