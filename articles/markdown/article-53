# CCtoCV: The Paladin's Quest for Level 2

Details of the paladin's beliefs and oath are pending.

The paladin's powers are enabled by a psychic-enhancement device contained in a medallion. The medallion is used by the alien Mollifiers as part of their dedication to cause. Mollifiers are the 'religious' cohort of alien.

Once the possessor of a medallion undertakes a process commitment to their system of belief and action, the medallion acts to focus and enhance both physical an mental capabilities in support of goals and actions consistent with the commitment.

This gives the aligned wearer of the medallion enhanced fighting ability and the other powers of a paladin.

To gain ownership of a medallion, the player must disrupt an alignment ceremony and steal the device. The device will enhance owner abilities just by simple possession, but to fully unlock its powers they must go through the 'commitment' process.
